This is a 'Command Line Interface' program to provide quick information about objects in the game 'Age of Empires 2'.

## Usage

Upon running this program you will be welcomed and promted with a list of options. These options are case sensitive and will request that you use a valid response. Selecting one of the subject options will give you a list of all items of that type to choose from. You will then be asked to choose an identifying number or return to the main menu. Chosing an item from a list will display more information about that item. Entering 'back' from a list will return you to the main menu. Entering 'leave' from the main menu only, will say 'Goodbye!!' and exit the program.
